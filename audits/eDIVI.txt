Mythril: The analysis was completed successfully. No issues were detected.

Issues:
1. All files are using solc ^0.8.7. Due to solc frequently releases new compiler versions, using an 
old version prevents access to new Solidity security checks. 

Stable version: 0.6.12/0.7.6

2. Contract name for eDIVI token is "eDIVI". This name not follows solidity naming convention.

3. Some functions could be marked as `external`, but is is used `public` due to Openzeppelin standard. 
Such functions as:

Mythril: The analysis was completed successfully. No issues were detected.

Issues:
1. All files are using solc ^0.8.7. Due to solc frequently releases new compiler versions, using an 
old version prevents access to new Solidity security checks. 

Stable version: 0.6.12/0.7.6

2. The use of assembly is error-prone and should be avoided.

Assembly usage is done by Openzeppelin standard and it is pretty safe.

You can find assembly usage at:
Address.isContract                          - lines 34-46
Address.verifyCallResult(bool,bytes,string) - lines 42-44
